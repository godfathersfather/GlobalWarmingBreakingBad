# GlobalWarmingBreakingBad
A Greek troll project on global warming that is breaking bad-themed. I love it.

There was supposed to be a folder named "builds" wherein the Makefile would create a folder either for linux or windows
accordingly and copy inside the assets, a DLL and a README.txt as well as the executable itself. You'd then zip that
and send it as a package to whoever. The DLL itself would only be needed if the package had been cross-compiled for windows.
